If a user with admin reviewed a pull request and found it eligible to be merge before the 3 reviews requirement is met the user may merge the pull request

A user with admin may merge a pull request before the required checks are passed

ALL request must be reviewed by a user with admin before the request is merged

If these rules are broken It will result in a band from this and similar repositories from my account
